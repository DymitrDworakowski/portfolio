**Contact Management Web Application** - This web application is designed to help users efficiently manage and organize their contacts. Built using React for the frontend, it offers a user-friendly interface to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts.

## Key Features:
- **Contact Management:** Users can add, edit, delete, and view detailed information about their contacts, including name, phone number, and email.
- **Favorites Feature:** Mark contacts as "favorites" to easily access frequently used contacts.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, allowing for seamless use across different screen sizes.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Changes made to contacts are immediately reflected in the UI, providing a dynamic and responsive experience.
- **Authentication:** User authentication is implemented to secure contact information, ensuring that only authorized users have access to their data.
