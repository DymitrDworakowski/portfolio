This project is a responsive Phonebook Application built with React on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end. The app allows users to manage their contacts, including adding, editing, and deleting contact information such as name, phone number, and email. Users can also mark contacts as "favorites" for easier access. The interface is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
